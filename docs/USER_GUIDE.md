# ClassBoard user guide

## The board

ClassBoard opens on a clean blackboard with the pen ready. The ribbon at the bottom holds:

`MORE · PEN · ERASER · SELECT · (active tool) · UNDO · REDO · FILE · INSERT · EDIT · ‹ page › · NEW PAGE · PAGE · − zoom + · fit · full screen`

* Tap **PEN**, **ERASER** or **SELECT** to switch tools. Tap the active tool again to open its
  options. A small caret on the button shows that options are available.
* **MORE** opens every other tool: shapes, geometry, equations, graphs, instruments, images,
  text, tables, templates, import/export and settings. When you pick one of these tools, it
  appears as an extra ribbon button. Tap that button to reopen the tool's options.
* **FILE** (new, open, save, import, export), **INSERT** (image, shape, text, graph, equation,
  table, PDF, PowerPoint) and **EDIT** (undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, duplicate, delete, select
  all) group the most used commands. On a narrow screen these groups are hidden; everything
  is still in MORE.
* Tap the **page indicator** (`3 / 12`) to open the page navigator, **NEW PAGE** to add a blank
  page, and **PAGE** for the page menu.
* Tap the **zoom percentage** for the View menu; **−** and **+** step through the zoom presets
  and the frame button fits the page.
* Tap anywhere outside a popover to close it.

## Touch, pen and mouse

| Action | Touch | Pen | Mouse |
|---|---|---|---|
| Draw / use tool | one finger (every finger on its own: up to 10 at once) | pen tip | left button |
| Pan | two fingers of one hand | – | right or middle drag, Shift + wheel |
| Zoom | pinch (two fingers of one hand) | – | wheel |
| Erase | three fingers held together or flat hand, wipe | pen eraser end | – |

* **Wipe (palm erase)**: put three fingers down side by side, touching or nearly touching, and
  wipe like a board eraser. It works in every tool, erases ink, shapes, lines, arrows,
  equations and other objects it passes over (pictures and imported slides stay), draws
  nothing itself and counts as a single undo step. Fingers that are spread apart are never
  a wipe. You can turn it off in Settings.
* **Writing with a pen:** while the pen touches or hovers over the board, touches are ignored,
  so the hand resting on the board neither draws nor erases.
* **Ten-point touch:** every finger that touches the board on its own writes its own line, so
  several students can write at the same time (as many fingers as the board reports,
  usually 10 or 20).
* **Zoom and pan** with two fingers of one hand (closer than about 16 cm). The second finger
  must land while the first one's line has only just started; that line is then removed.
  Zooming only starts when nobody else is writing, so other people's lines are never bent,
  and fingers that touch somewhere else while you zoom wait until you are done.
* **Every finger draws** (Settings): turns two-finger zoom off, so fingers close together
  draw too. Useful with young pupils who zoom by accident.

## Tools

* **Pen.** Styles: pen, highlighter, dashed and dotted. You can set thickness and colour,
  turn stylus pressure on or off, and enable *shape recognition*. With recognition on,
  roughly drawn lines, circles, rectangles and triangles become clean shapes.
* **Magic Highlighter** (in the Pen menu, next to Highlighter). Draw to point something out
  while you explain: the mark appears at once, stays for about five seconds, then fades
  away by itself. Magic marks are not part of the lesson: they are not saved or exported and
  Undo / Redo ignore them. It works with the pen, a finger and the mouse. Choosing another
  pen style switches back to normal ink.
* **Eraser.** *Stroke* removes whole lines, *Object* removes anything you touch, and *Area*
  rubs out exactly the ink under the eraser. *Clear page* asks for confirmation first, and you
  can undo it.
* **Select.** Tap an object (inside an empty rectangle or circle works too), drag a rectangle,
  or draw a lasso. Drag a selected object to move it. Corner handles
  resize and the round handle rotates (it snaps to 15°). Line and polygon points can be
  dragged individually. The floating bar offers edit, colour, front/back, duplicate, copy and
  delete. Double-tap text, formulas, graphs or tables to edit them.
* **Shapes** (MORE → Shapes). Tap a shape, then drag on the board, or just tap for a default
  size. Hold Shift for squares, circles and 45° lines. To draw a free polygon, tap its corners
  and then tap the first corner again (or double-tap, or press Enter).
* **Text** (MORE → Text). Tap the board and type. Size, bold/italic/underline, alignment and
  colour apply to the text you're editing or to the selected text boxes.

## Geometry

* **Instruments.** The ruler, protractor, set square and compass lie on the board:
  * drag the body to move an instrument;
  * drag the round arrow to rotate it (it snaps to 15°), or use two fingers to move and rotate
    at once;
  * tap × to put it away.
  * **Ruler and set square.** Start drawing with the pen near an edge and the line follows
    that edge exactly. The length is shown while you draw. Drag the tab at the end of the
    ruler to change its length.
  * **Protractor.** Drag the blue and orange knobs to measure an angle. The ∠ button stamps
    the measured angle onto the page.
  * **Compass.** Drag the pencil to draw an arc or a full circle. Drag the hinge to change the
    radius, and drag the needle leg to move it.
* **Measurements.** Distance, angle, slope and area. The values update when you move the
  points with Select.
* **Constructions.** Points (named A, B, C … and labelled with coordinates), segments, lines,
  rays and vectors. They snap to existing points and, on grid backgrounds or inside graphs,
  to whole coordinates.
* **Coordinates.** *Coordinate plane background* puts numbered axes on the page. The unit is
  1 cm = one grid square.
* **Exact values.** Select a line, vector, measurement, point or shape and tap the precision
  button in the floating bar (or double-tap it). Type or step exact values: length and
  direction of lines, the angle of an angle measurement (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° … in one tap),
  rise, run, slope and slope angle, a vector's magnitude and direction, a shape's width and
  height (area and perimeter are shown). Dragging still works and the values follow.
* **Scale.** In the property panel tap *Change scale* (or MORE → Measurements → Scale) and set
  e.g. *10 cm = 1 km*. Lengths, areas, perimeters and vectors are then shown in real units
  (a 7 cm line reads 0.7 km), and you can enter real values (1 km draws a 10 cm line). Graphs
  keep their own axes.

## Equations

MORE → Equation. Type LaTeX-style input or tap the palette, and the preview updates live.
Examples: `\frac{a}{b}`, `x^{2}`, `x_{n}`, `\sqrt{x}`, `\sqrt[3]{x}`, `\int_{0}^{1} f(x)\,dx`,
`\sum_{i=1}^{n} i`, `\lim_{x \to 0}`, `\vec{v}`, `\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}`,
and Greek letters such as `\alpha` or `\pi`. Double-tap a formula to edit it.

**✨ Magic Equation Maker** (optional): write an expression with the pen, select the
handwriting with SELECT and tap ✨ in the floating bar (or in the Equation panel). ClassBoard
recognises it offline and shows a preview: **Accept** replaces the handwriting with an
editable equation (one undo brings the handwriting back), **Edit** lets you correct the
formula first, **Cancel** leaves everything as it was. If it cannot read the handwriting it
says so and offers **Try again** (best guess), **Edit manually** (the Equation panel) or
**Cancel**. It never changes handwriting on its own. The built-in recogniser reads digits,
x, y, a, b, c, n, + − = ( ), powers such as x² and simple fractions.

## Graphs

MORE → Function / Graph → *Insert graph*.

* Type functions such as `2x + 1`, `a*sin(b x) + c`, `x² − 4`, `|x|`, `sqrt(x)` or `f(x) = e^x`.
* Letters other than x become **parameters**, each with its own slider.
* Drag inside the graph to pan and pinch to zoom. You can also use the zoom buttons.
* *Tap to place points* adds points that snap onto curves. Tap a point again to remove it.
* Add vectors by typing their components, and create value tables for the visible functions.
* Measurements and constructions placed inside a graph use the graph's units.

## Pages

* **NEW PAGE** adds a page after the current one.
* **PAGE** menu: *New page*, *Duplicate page*, *Clear page* (removes everything on the page,
  keeps the page — asks first, can be undone) and *Delete page* (removes the page itself; Undo
  in the message brings it back). It also opens *Page size*, *Background* and *Templates*.
* **Page size:** classroom board 16:9, 4:3, A4, A3 (landscape or portrait) or a custom size in
  cm, for this page, all pages or new pages. Sizes are logical: 1 cm on the page is 1 cm in
  measurements, on any screen.
* **Background:** white, black, light grey, blackboard green, more colours or any custom colour
  (#RRGGBB), for this page or all pages. Grid and line patterns are kept.
* In the page navigator you can tap a thumbnail to open it, drag thumbnails to reorder them
  (or use the ◀ ▶ buttons), and duplicate, clear, delete or rename a page.
* **Templates** (MORE → Templates) apply to this page, all pages, or new pages. *Background
  from image* and *Save this background* create custom templates that every lesson can use.

## Files

* **MORE → Lesson** has new, open, save, save as and recent lessons. Lessons are
  `.classboard` files.
* **Autosave** keeps a recovery copy while there are unsaved changes. The interval is set in
  Settings. If ClassBoard or the computer stops unexpectedly, the next start offers to restore
  the lesson.
* **Import.** Images (or drag them onto the board, or paste), pages from another lesson, PDF
  documents and PowerPoint presentations (.ppt, .pptx). Each PDF page or slide becomes a board
  page of the same shape (PDF pages keep their size, e.g. A4) that you can write on. Drag a
  PDF or presentation onto the board to import it.
* **Export.** PDF (current page, whole lesson or a page range such as `1-3, 5`), PowerPoint
  (one slide per page) and PNG of the current page. Exports always contain the complete page,
  whatever the zoom.
